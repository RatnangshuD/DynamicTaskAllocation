Multiagent Dynamic Task Assignment Based on Forest Fire Point Model

The work delves into the complexities of multiagent dynamic task assignment in forest fire management. It explores the optimization problem considering various factors like fire spread, firefighting agent characteristics and movement speeds, and the number of deployed agents. The primary aim is to minimize task completion time. The research establishes a model for fire spread and task assignments, proving that an optimal static task assignment ensures uniform task completion times under specific assumptions. Additionally, it calculates the optimal solution for static task assignment, laying the groundwork for both initial and dynamic deployment strategies. A dynamic task assignment scheme is proposed, ensuring reduced completion times with each reassignment and balancing task completion times. MATLAB simulations validate the effectiveness of this dynamic scheme against an auction algorithm. The study aims to guide decision-makers in designing strategic assignment approaches and solving optimization problems in diverse scenarios.
